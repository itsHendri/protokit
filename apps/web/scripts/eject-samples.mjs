/**
 * scripts/eject-samples.mjs — remove the dashboard, landing and assistant samples.
 *
 *   npm run eject-samples
 *
 * The samples show what the kit can build. On a real project they are the first thing to go, and
 * deleting them by hand is easy to half-do. This removes their routes and mock data and the kit home's
 * "Sample apps" section (between the samples:start / samples:end markers), then says what to run.
 * It is deliberately not reversible: use git.

/**
 * scripts/eject-samples.mjs — remove the shop and habits sample apps.
 *
 *   npm run eject-samples
 *
 * The samples exist to show what the kit can build. On a real project they are the
 * first thing to go, and deleting them by hand means six steps across four places —
 * easy to half-do and ship a client a prototype with a habit tracker in the tab bar.
 *
 * This removes the routes, the mock stores, the root Stack entries and the kit-home
 * links, then tells you what to run. It is deliberately not reversible: use git.

description: Quality gate for the prototype kit — typecheck, lint, token/hex/icon guards, then a real look at the affected screens on the iOS simulator (and web) in light and dark. Use after adding or changing components, screens, tokens, or before committing/publishing. Never report "done" without running this.
---

# QC pass

Run everything; do not stop at the first failure. Report each check as pass/fail with the
exact output for failures.

## 1. Static checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint -- --max-warnings 0
npm run tokens:build && git diff --quiet -- global.css lib/theme.ts tokens/generated || echo "TOKENS OUT OF DATE: commit the regenerated files"
```

## 2. Guards (must print nothing)

```bash
# no hard-coded colours in components or screens
grep -rnE "#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b|rgba?\(" app components --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v "lib/theme"
# no other icon libraries (lucide icon refs are fine anywhere; they render through <Icon as>)
grep -rln "@expo/vector-icons\|react-native-vector-icons" app components || true
# react-native Text must not be used directly (use components/ui/text)
grep -rnE "import \{[^}]*\bText\b[^}]*\} from 'react-native'" app components/kit
# every components/ui + components/kit file has a registry section
for f in components/ui/*.tsx components/kit/*.tsx; do n=$(basename "$f" .tsx); grep -rqi "id: '$n'" components/devkit/sections || echo "UNREGISTERED: $f"; done 2>/dev/null
```

Known exemptions: `native-only-animated-view`, `icon`, `text`, `label` are helpers and are
registered indirectly. Everything else must appear.

## 3. On-device look

Start the servers with the `kit-ios` (Expo Go on the booted simulator) and `kit-web` launch
configs. For each affected section:

1. Open it: `xcrun simctl openurl booted "exp://localhost:8091/--/kitchen-sink/<category>"`.
2. Screenshot in the current scheme, flip the theme (header button), screenshot again.
3. Tap the interactive parts: open overlays, toggle switches, type in inputs, long-press
   context menus. Confirm sheets clear the home indicator and nothing is clipped.
4. On web (`http://localhost:8090/kitchen-sink/<category>`) confirm the same section renders
   and the console has no errors.

Expo Go note: haptics and blur render on the simulator; a physical device is only needed for
feel, not layout.

## 4. Report

List: checks run, results, screenshots taken, anything deferred (and why) added to BACKLOG.md.
